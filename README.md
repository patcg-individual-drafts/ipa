# Interoperable Private Attribution (IPA)

IPA is a [Private Measurement proposal](https://github.com/patcg/private-measurement) for the W3C's [Private Advertising Technology Community Group (PATCG.)](https://github.com/patcg/).

## Latest Protocol Draft
[IPA End to End](IPA-End-to-End.md) is our latest version of the proposal.

We also have a [formal analysis posted on ePrint.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/437)



## Implementation
We are actively [prototyping an implementation](https://github.com/private-attribution/ipa).

## Get Involved

The [PATCG hosts meetings](https://github.com/patcg/meetings) on a roughly bi-monthly basis. Anyone can [sign up to join the community group](https://www.w3.org/community/patcg/) and join these meetings.

The IPA team also hosts an [IPA focused bi-weekly VC call to discuss open issues and progress](https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/ipa/issues/47).

[We also have open research questions in the issues on this repo.](https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/ipa/labels/research%20questions)
